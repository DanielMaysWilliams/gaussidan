# GaussiDan #

Fitting a Gaussian curve to data is something us particle physicists do a lot, and in Python it can be surprisingly difficult! The aim of this package is to provide a simple method for fitting a Gaussian to data and making a plot of the data and fitted curve. 

## Modules ##

### Fitting ###
`fit_gaussian(data, bins, weights=None)`

### Plotting ###
`plot_gaussian(data, bins, weights=None)`
